## Why

Finding friends to play online video games with is hard. Sometimes life gets in the way and schedules don't line up. Or maybe you just don't have any friends to begin with. Don't fret because that's where Squad Armory comes in! Find your favorite game and join a squad that's looking exactly for whatever role you play. Can't find one that's right for you? Create your own squad and find your perfect teammates! Whether you're looking for something more casual or more competitive, you can be as general or as specific as you'd like when creating a squad. Chat with your new squadmates within the app and plan out your gaming session. Squad up and join Squad Armory!
